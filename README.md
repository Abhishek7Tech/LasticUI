Agile Coretime is set to debut on Polkadot, introducing a new system that optimizes blockspace allocation, enabling users to purchase and manage time-based assets efficiently. This innovation has spurred the creation of secondary marketplaces like Lastic, where users can trade Coretime in a user-friendly environment. Our hackathon project enhances Lastic by adding a feature for the partitioning and interlacing of Coretime NFTs, aiming to boost market efficiency. We're prioritizing user experience and interface design to ensure that dividing Coretime assets is straightforward for all users.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), uses pnpm and Tailwind css.

## üìÅ Directory Overview

The repository is organized into two primary directories:

1. `./static-frontend`:
   - Contains the static frontend integrated with wallet connection functionality.
   - Serves as the boilerplate code that will evolve into the official Lastic website.
   - Design mirrors what's showcased in the `Figma UI`. As of now, the graphs are populated with mockup data.
