# LasticUI

Welcome to the **LasticUI** repository! This repository is dedicated to enabling seamless interaction with the Coretime Parachain.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into three primary directories:

1. `./static_frontend`: 
   - Contains the static frontend integrated with wallet connection functionality.
   - Serves as the boilerplate code that will evolve into the official Lastic website.
   - Design mirrors what's showcased in the `Figma UI`. As of now, the graphs are populated with mockup data.

2. `./substrate_interact`: 
   - Developed on top of the [`substrate-front-end-template`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template.git).
   - By following the guidelines in `./substrate_interact/README.md`, you can interact with the Coretime chain seamlessly.

3. `./core_chain_sdk`: 
   - Contains preliminary code destined for a separate repository.
   - Currently, it houses boilerplate code essential for building an SDK to interact with the Coretime chain.
