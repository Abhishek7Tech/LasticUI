      question: "What is Lastic?",
      answer: "Lastic is the world's first true blockspace marketplace. It revolutionizes the way blockspace can be exchanged with the flexibility required for applications across all web3 ecosystems. Using Polkadotâ€™s coretime model as its foundation, it ensures applications can access the blockspace they need, and blockspace providers can tailor its packaging according to market demands."
  },
  {
      question: "How does Lastic differ from current blockspace marketplaces?",
      answer: "Current blockspace marketplaces often refer to tools that MEV actors use to reorder transactions within a block for specific virtual machines or state-transition-functions. Lastic, on the other hand, offers a marketplace where buyers can manipulate the blockspace they've purchased in any way they desire, such as reordering transactions, scaling up their processing, deploying smart contracts, and more."
  },
  {
      question: "What challenges does Lastic address?",
      answer: "Lastic addresses challenges like the absence of a dedicated marketplace for buying and selling coretime in flexible chunks on Polkadot, the difficulty in obtaining cores on-demand, and the inability to sell excess blockspace, create partnerships, or acquire fine-grained coretime."
  },
  {
      question: "What features does Lastic offer?",
      answer: "Lastic provides features like market-based scaling, support for automated governance-controlled parameters, customizable coretime chunks, variable timeslices, and a wide range of payment options inspired by energy markets, including real-time spot market, day-ahead market, forward contracts, and capacity markets."
  },
  {
      question: "What architecture is Lastic planning to use?",
      answer: "Lastic is considering three potential architectures: as a Parachain, as a smart contract on a Parachain similar to Uniswap, or as a smart contract on Coretime Chain. Each has its own tradeoffs. A user interface showcasing the current state of coretime is also deemed necessary."
  },
  {
      question: "Will Lastic introduce its own token?",
      answer: "The Lastic team is currently exploring this option. However, irrespective of the decision, a fee-per-transaction revenue structure is anticipated."
  },
  {
      question: "What is Lastic's future outlook?",
      answer: "Lastic aims to be the leading blockspace marketplace across the entire web3 ecosystem, as Polkadot is strategically placed to validate a variety of VM and chain types including ZK Rollups, Optimistic Rollups, and more."
